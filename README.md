## Overview
Welcome to the Mobile Robots Project! This project focuses on utilizing Python to control robots within the Aseba framework. We are integrating computer vision capabilities to enable our robots to detect objects and respond with appropriate commands.

## Features
- **Robot Control with Python**: Harnessing the power of Python to interact with robots in the Aseba environment.
- **Object Detection**: Implementing computer vision techniques to detect objects in the robot's environment.
- **Command Execution**: Translating visual input into actionable commands for the robot to execute.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Mobile Robots Project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install Aseba and familiarize yourself with its environment.
   - Set up a suitable Python development environment.

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`
   - Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Running the Project**:
   - Launch the Aseba Thymio environment.
   - Create events with 0 variables: walk300, walk200, walk100, walk50, left_turn, right_turn, stop
   - Run: `tymio_control.ipynb`

## Usage
Detailed usage instructions for controlling robots and processing visual input.

- **Controlling Robots**:
  - How to send commands to robots.
  - Example codes and scenarios.

- **Computer Vision**:
  - Setting up cameras and processing input.
  - Algorithms used for object detection.
